        <h3 >Human Development Index - HDI</h3>
        <p>The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistic developed and compiled by the United Nations to measure and various
        countries' levels of social and economic development.<br> It is composed of four principal areas of interest: mean years of
        schooling expected years of schooling, life expectancy at birth, and gross national income per capita. This index is a
        tool used to follow changes in development levels over time and to compare the development levels of different
        countries.</p>

            <ul>
            <li>The HDI is a measurement system used by the United Nations to evaluate the level of individual human development in each
            country.</li>
            <li>The HDI uses components such as average annual income and educational expectations to rank and compare countries.</li>
            <li>The HDI has been criticized by social advocates for not representing a broad enough measure of quality of life and by
            economists for providing little additional useful information beyond simpler measures of the economic standard of living

                    <p>The HDI rankings of european countries have seen a fair share of fluctualition. Some countries have seen high increase 
                        in HDI rankings while others have dropped dramatically. There's a significant pattern that could be noticed and that is 
                        ,the countries with a decrease or low increase in the HDI ranking were situated in the western side of europe while the 
                        eastern side of europe saw countries have their HDI increase during the 2010 to 2015 period.<br><br>
                        what has eastern europe done during that time to improve their Human development index. Is this a trend that could continue
                         in the next 5 years? Could we see a position where an eastern europen county surpasses the Big countries HDI like the  likes of UK or Germany ?

                <div class="col-sm">
                    <p>Life expectancy is the key metric for assessing population health. Broader than the narrow metric of the infant and
                    child mortality, which focus solely at mortality at a young age, life expectancy captures the mortality along the entire
                    life course. It tells us the average age of death in a population.
                    <br>
                    Estimates suggest that in a pre-modern, poor world, life expectancy was around 30 years in all regions of the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Life expectancy has increased rapidly since the Age of Enlightenment. In the early 19th century, life expectancy started
                    to increase in the early industrialized countries while it stayed low in the rest of the world. This led to a very high
                    inequality in how health was distributed across the world. Good health in the rich countries and persistently bad health
                    in those countries that remained poor. 
                    <br><br>Over the last decades this global inequality decreased. No country in the world
                    has a lower life expectancy than the countries with the highest life expectancy in 1800. Many countries that not long
                    ago were suffering from bad health are catching up rapidly.</p>

            <h3>GNI per Capita vs HDI rank</h3>

                    <p>Compared to GDP, the HDI has a greater emphasis on human development. It takes the quality of life into account, not
                    just production capacity of a country. Education and health are considered as important to a country as economic power.
                    GDP is considered a means to human development, but not an end.<br><br> GNI per capita, which is essentially the average
                    person’s purchasing power, is an important factor in calculating Human Development Index, but just one of several. The
                    Human Development Index paints a more holistic picture of a country than GDP. For example, countries with the same GDPs
                    can have vastly different HDIs. </p>

                <div class="col-sm">
                    <p>If two countries have similar GDPs but their HDIs are out of sync, it can help policy
                        makers identify the fundamental issues in their countries that need to be addressed, such as education or
                        health.
                        Finally, it more accurately depicts changes in living standard over time.<br> As a drastic example, if from one year
                        to the
                        next every employee in a country’s tobacco and weapons industry suddenly became academics or joined the health
                        industry
                        to treat people, find cures, develop vaccinations, etc. <br><br>As seen from the chart on the right and on top, the countries
                         with the GNI per capita compared to the GNI per capita minus HDI ranking were mainly from eastern european countries.
                         This shows that theres still more progress to be made to be able to catch up to the rest of the european countries
